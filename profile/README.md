## Hey, this is Loro 👋

We develop toolkits for building local-first software applications. It
simplifies tasks such as:

- 🚀 Creating real-time and asynchronous collaborative applications, even in
  peer-to-peer connections
- ✍️ Enabling offline editing
- 🚅 Developing applications with built-in version control

Loro uses Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to resolve parallel edits.
By utilizing Loro's data types, your applications can be made collaborative and
maintain a complete history of state changes with minimal overhead.
